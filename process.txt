create py -m venv env
pip install flask pymongo passlib
create app.py
create run file- and then we can run using "flask run" code in terminal
now create html pages in templates: dashboard.html, base.html,home.html

static folder- jquery for form submissions , style.css for style, normalize for uniformality in page
and add those in base.html

in js folder create: scripts.js for forms management and all
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

now make a user folder which has __init__,models-contains all the main definitions for letting us login,routes- managing all the routing here so import app from app.py


write scripts.js file (copy)
modify models.py by adding the requests.. and encrypting password and all..

Now lets connect to the mongodb database using pymongo in app.py file and create database configuration 
-create client instance-host +port(default)
-database variable db=client.data_base_name

then do some changes in model.py regrding the checking in database and start making session in this model.py

next to use sesison in flask we need to create a secret key in flask and we can actually use python to generate a unique keyusing code " python -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))' "

now lets build signout in routes.py that directs to model.py where we have the sunction and use session.clear to logout directly
